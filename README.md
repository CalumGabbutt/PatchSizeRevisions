# PatchSizeRevisions
Revisions to the fission rate estimates made in Baker et al., Cell Reports, 2014

In this Jupyter Notebook we explore the effects of revisions to the ['Quantification of Crypt and Stem Cell Evolution in the Normal and Neoplastic Human Colon'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124714005889) paper. These revisions include errors in the process used to correct the data for the spontaneous labelling of adjacent crypts and the inclusion of data from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) samples, rather than the flash-frozen tissue described in the manuscript. 

We show that the inclusion of the FFPE data does not significantly alter the mean fission rates of the patient cohort, whereas the revised correction significantly lowers the estimated mean fission rates (for normal patients the original estimate of the mean fission rate was 0.028 divisions/year/crypt, whilst the revised estimate for these patients is 0.009 divisions/year/crypt)
